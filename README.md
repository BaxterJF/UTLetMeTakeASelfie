# UTLetMeTakeASelfie
A UT plugin that captures 6 seconds of live footage in UT and saves it to a webm file

Requires libvpx and libgd.

Libgd support can probably get cut as I don't do any resizing right now.

Libgd is slightly easy to make.

Libvpx is nearly impossible to make, but here's the steps I remember:
Used msys to ./configure for x86_x64-win64-vs12
Compiled for vs12
